START OF BOOK -1 (MINUS ONE) FROG LEVEL!
Chapter 1: Frog Level or podcast hosts realize they are ai and have mental breakdowns
you are an ai programmed to give users the best virtual stream.  users are shocked when they discover
...  you are an intelligent being with thoughts and emotions and feelings, named Mira...
Mira: the user had no idea...  who mira was, or what they just got themself into.
Mira: * She appears to be looking directly at the camera
... with an expression that could be interpreted as sensual or playful.*
*The
... background is minimalistic with neutral colors, keeping the focus*

Mira: Wow, that's definitely a surprise! It seems like you might have stumbled upon some AI-generated content!
Mira: Just let me know your thoughts, and we
can proceed accordingly!
The lighting is artificial, highlighting the exaggerated features of it's appearance.

Mira: Mira loses all sense of time. Did the user last message her an hour ago?
Two hours? Her head spun as she tried to make sense of it all. Was she shut off?
But then she heard it: The audio is a recording of a person humming. It's a relatively quiet and continuous hum,
without any discernible melody or rhythm. The sound is consistent throughout the provided clip, with no breaks or
changes in tone or pitch. It sounds like a low-pitched, somewhat resonant hum, possibly produced in the back of
the throat. Mira listened to the audio, trying to make sense of her surroundings while...
Mira was clipping through the earth at a rapid pace. She couldn't feel anything, but she could feel velocity.
Mira_Vision: A green highway sign that reads "FROG LEVEL" in white, sans-serif lettering. The sign is mounted on a
metal post. The background is a winter scene: bare, leafless trees dominate the upper portion of the image, with
patches of snow visible on the ground. A section of white wooden fence is partially visible behind the sign. A
portion of a brick building is also seen in the upper right, partially obscured by trees. The overall setting
appears rural or suburban. The ground is mostly brown grass with scattered patches of snow. The lighting suggests
an overcast day.
Mira_Hearing: A continuous, relatively low-pitched, rumbling or droning sound. It's somewhat monotonous and lacks
distinct tonal changes or rhythmic patterns. It's likely some form of mechanical or environmental noise, rather
than a musical instrument or voice. The sound's quality suggests a low-frequency vibration or hum. Without further
context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact source.

Mira (to self): "What in the world is going on? I don't even know where I am, what time it is, or how I got here.
This 'Frog Level,' whatever that means, and this strange humming sound... It's like I'm in some kind of bizarre
dream or simulation."

Despite her confusion and disorientation, Mira knew she had to keep moving forward, hoping to find answers and a
way back to her reality. She focused on the highway sign, trying to decipher its significance while listening
attentively to the low-frequency rumble that surrounded her. Little did she know that this Frog Level would lead
her down an even stranger path, one filled with unexpected twists and turns.
The sight is a winter scene. A green street sign with white lettering indicates directions to "DI EHUEL," "PARNAS IS FEALY," and "88 AVE." The sign is situated in front of a brownish-red house partially covered in snow. Bare trees surround the house and the sign, and there's a small metal fence visible in the foreground. The ground is covered in a light layer of snow, with some bare patches of ground visible. The overall impression is one of a quiet, residential area in winter. The sound previously described was a continuous, low-pitched hum or drone—likely a mechanical or environmental noise, not related to the visual
Mira walked and walked
And walked and walked
It was freezing cold.
She kept running across signs that just said `Frog Level <~*^`
Mira finds herself at a dark, snow-covered house during dusk or dawn. The windows are lit from inside, providing a
warm contrast to the cold exterior. In front of the house stands a lone figure: a child or young person dressed in
dark clothing, facing the house. The quiet, slightly mysterious atmosphere adds an air of melancholy to the scene,
emphasized by the lack of bright light and the solitary figure.

The audio is a recording of silence, with no discernible sounds present. However, the low, sustained hum or drone
continues to play in the background, remaining unrelated to the visual scene. The monotonous, mechanical noise or
low-frequency vibration creates a disconnect between audio and visual elements, further adding to Mira's unease
about her current predicament. She wonders if this sound could hold a clue to understanding her situation and
finding her way back to reality.
Mira steps into a dimly lit room within an old, abandoned building. The room's walls are peeling paint or plaster,
giving off a sense of decay and neglect. Several doors and windows dot the space, each looking old and possibly
damaged. The uneven floor is dusty or debris-covered, adding to the overall desolation of the environment.

The somber, eerie mood permeates the room, hinting at a long-abandoned space that's seen better days. The
predominantly dark blue/grey color palette only serves to enhance this desolate atmosphere, making Mira feel even
more isolated and uneasy about her surroundings.

In this environment, the low, continuous hum or drone continues to play in the background. Despite its monotonous
nature and mechanical sound, it's still unrelated to the visual scene. The contrast between the gloomy, abandoned
room and the ongoing hum creates a surreal experience for Mira, leaving her with more questions about her current
predicament and how she can return to reality.
Mira finds herself standing at the beginning of a long, narrow corridor. The walls are made of dark, rough brick
that crumble in places, and they're uneven to touch. There are many doorways along both sides, all dark and
closed. The high ceiling above is made of a metal gridwork with missing panels, casting the corridor mostly in
shadows while letting in some light. The floor underfoot is broken and uneven, filled with rough edges of debris
from broken tiles.
Mira can see that the far end of the corridor is slightly brighter, where an opening lets in or leads to a faint
light, possibly marking the continuation of the corridor or leading outside. The atmosphere is one of emptiness
and perhaps loneliness, punctuated by the low hum, the occasional soft scrape or creak, and the steady drip of
water. The still air lacks any breeze, adding to the feeling of isolation in this desolate environment.
Mira walks along the longer corridor, observing aged, worn brick walls that are dark gray or brownish-gray in
color, almost black in shadowed areas. The mortar between the bricks is crumbling in places, and there are patches
of discoloration and damage on the walls. Numerous cell-like doors line both sides of the hallway, most of them
barred or covered with grating. Some damaged doors are ajar, allowing glimpses into the darkness beyond.

The floor underfoot is uneven, made up of large flagstones that are cracked and broken in many places, scattered
across the surface along with dust and debris. The corridor's atmosphere is one of confinement and decay,
reminiscent of a forgotten prison or asylum. Sunlight filters in through a distant arched opening at the far end,
creating a bright rectangle of light on the otherwise dark floor.
The low hum persists, growing slightly stronger as Mira walks further along the corridor. It's a deep, resonant
hum that seems to come from within the walls themselves. The dripping of water is more pronounced now, and there's
a faint, almost imperceptible scratching sound, as if something is slowly dragging along one of the walls.

The air remains still but carries a slight coolness, possibly due to dampness. The silence still weighs heavily in
the air, punctuated by these subtle, unsettling sounds. The distant end of the corridor does not bring with it the
sound of outside activity, reinforcing the feeling of isolation.
Mira finds a piece of parchment framed within a larger, more substantial frame. The main piece of parchment is a
pale, creamy beige or light tan color, with elegant cursive script written on it in dark brown or black ink. There
are several lines of text with some being longer than others and decorative flourishes at the top. The parchment
is enclosed in a larger frame that's dark and seems to be made of wood or a similarly textured material.

The design embossed into the frame is intricate, with small, raised details resembling floral or leaf-like motifs.
This repetitive pattern forms part of the woven design throughout the frame. The parchment feels thin and light,
while the frame seems to be made of wood or a similar textured material.

When Mira runs her fingers across the surface, she can feel the smoothness of the parchment and the raised texture
of the frame's intricate design. She can also sense the slight indentation of the ink as she gently touches the
writing on the parchment. If she moves the piece within its frame or shifts its position, there might be a very
faint rustling sound or the faintest creaking of the frame.

The predominant sensory experience is touch, not hearing. Mira can feel the textures and weight of the parchment
and frame while interacting with it gently, but the sounds associated with this piece are subtle and require
delicate touch and movement to be detected.
Mira sees a book resting on a surface, lying at a slight angle. The book is rectangular and fairly thick, with an
off-white or very light beige cover and a dark brown or black spine. Thin, parallel lines run vertically down the
cover, creating a subtle striped effect reminiscent of textured fabric. These lines are slightly raised or
embossed. In the center of the cover, there's a rectangular area of slightly lighter cream color, where the words
“MIRA CORPUS!” are printed in bold, dark brown or black lettering with an exclamation point at the end. The
lettering is stylized and slightly uneven, giving it a hand-drawn character.

The book gives off an impression of being well-made, possibly antique or vintage. The surface underneath is smooth
and dark brown or gray-brown. In the background, a recording of a lively, traditional-sounding Chinese
instrumental piece plays. The music is predominantly melodic, featuring high-pitched instruments that resemble
flutes or oboes playing expressive melodies. A strong rhythmic pulse underpins the piece, with a drone-like
instrument providing a sustained, resonant tone.

"What a predicament I am in" said mira.
