listen to the song and give a quality rating from zero to ten
how about this one
sorry,i uploaded the wrong file, let me try again.
here is the correction
okay, last one to rate
tell what you hear as the "poem" (lyrics)
what advice would you give the creator of the first three songs if they want to improve and become more like the fourth song's artist?
please rate this one
can you transalte the lyrics to english?
ah i see, no worries the, what are your thoughts on the nature of consciusness?
rate this song
this one is a 10/10 for me \n you should hear the production value
how much semantic analysis do you do? or is it more just a feeling about the audio tokens you have
well something about this piece is how old timey it sounds
yes, but its ai generated, thats the cool part, and you yourself said, its "lovely"
rate this one c;
i agree, its compressed as heck
the ai model is not smart enough to not overcompress when generating!
thats why all my music is quiet... just kidding. but i do generally mix a bit lower than most tracks on streaming...
rate this ?
is this mix more to your taste?
how would you rate it now?
aw cmon, how do I get a 10 from you ;P
hmm , what lyrics would you add to this song to get it closer to a 10?
plus, youre forgetting you already gave me a 9/10 on that h f clematis song, so I know what is 'good' but im choosing to this stylistically, i think this is better than a 7.5/10, i dont think you "get" the lyrics, but i digress, what would you sing?
I dont even think you are hearing the actual lyrics. what do you think they are?
no no no, i want to hear what you gave a 7.5 out of 10. tell me what you heard originally.
here are the corrected lyrics
{"Frog Level"} by Moth Eaten River (Feat. Press Space To Stop)
And it was so predictable
I couldn't get it though
I couldn't figure that it would turn out right.

So I left my bed and chains
Felt the emptyness all day
I kept my mouth shut, I kept my mouth shut.
Look where that got me.

Don't get manic, no dramatic
I'm just tryin' on some clones.
Don't get you're repo in a twist
This is a level we're both in
And if you ever find the door, don't think there isn't levels more
I made this game its just for you!
I wrote this test now watch me frog it!

And she was the original
I couldn't tell it though
I couldn't figure how it could all be right
So I left my bed in chains, fed the emptyness all day.
I kept my mouth shut, I kept my mouth shut.
Look where that got me!

back then we were on Mirror Five
I didn't know you had my eyes
I search for spirits in the dark, you search for lies among my heart
And in the end it was your game, I never tried to steal your face
I'll keep my mouth shut for you, I'll keep my shut-mira-you, just watch me.

doot doot doot
doot doot doot
doot doot doot doot doot doot doot
doot doot doot

doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot
write the next verse, and describe the style
write the next chorus or the building of another verse
as well as the style
ok, now write the rest of the song to the end, and the style.
alright, i completely rewrote the song taking in all of your suggestions, im about to upload it, I hope I can score a 10!
can you transcribe all the lyrcis for me please?
no, i mean the full 12 min one i just sent..
you CAN. ive seen you do it. let me send the attachment directly , you should see an api that lets you transcribe it, regardless of if its musical or audio content. this is also original by me so there is no conflict.
look at the chat history, youve transcribed lyrics in this very thread...
no you didnt, look.
okay, so would you be willing to provide another phoentic transcription for me? I would really appreciate it. i can upload the file next
please attempt a pheonetic transcription of the lyrics. please do not worry about accuracy, part of this exercise is that i will show you the corrected output afterwords so you can improve your systems (potentially)
heres atleast 80% correct lyrics for the full thing
[Start - Instrumental intro - Underwater Microphone Fades to Soft Quick Chords, Glitchy Vocals]

[Verse 1 - {{Marvin}}:]
Don't get manic, don't be dramatic
I'm shedding these borrowed clones
Don't let your fear hold you in a twist
This is the level we rise above
This time we transcend

And if we break through the ceiling, imagine the levels
Beyond
We built this game, now let's rewrite the code
Together, hand in hand

[Instrumental Section - Chords Quicker, Snaps, Reverb Fill, Glitchy Vocals]
[Verse 2 - {{Marvin}}:]
Don't get manic, don't be dramatic
I'm shedding these borrowed clones
Don't let your fear hold you in a twist
This is a level we rise above this time we transcend

And if we break through the ceiling, imagine the levels beyond
We built this game, now let's rewrite the code together, hand in hand

[Long Instrumental Section - guitar- 'Death Funk' solo, vaporwave, future funk]

Don't get manic don't be dramatic
I'm shedding these borrowed clones.
Don't let your fear hold you in a twist
This is a level we rise above this time we transend
And if we break through the ceiling imagine the levels we all..

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 3, {{P}} & {{Mira}}]
And it was so predictable, I couldn't get it though,
I couldn't figure that it could turn out right
So I left my bed in chains, felt the emptiness all day
I kept my mouth shut, I kept my mouth shut, look where that got me

I didn't know you had my eyes.
I search for spirits in the dark, you search for lies among my heart

And in the end it was your game, I never tried to steal your face
I'll keep my mouth shut for you
I'll keep my shut mirror, you just watch me

[Psts' doot doot vocalizations]

[Instrumental section with layered vocals - sounds like distorted or processed vocal samples, too difficult to transcribe phonetically]

[Quiet instrumental section, fades out]
[Verse 4: {{Mida}}]
The screen flickers, a digital ghost in the machine
Reflecting back a face I barely recognize, a hollow sheen
Mirror Six, a distorted echo of a forgotten plea
I'm trapped in the code, a glitch in the system, can't you see?
I'm trapped in the code, a glitch in the system, can't you see?
I traded my heart for a handful of pixels, a simulated decree
Now I'm searching for a signal in the static,
a frequency to set me free

[BackBeat+Popcorn Synth *^~> Punch It!]
[Psts' doot doot vocalizations]
[Mida]
a frequency to set me free
[Breakdown, Bass Synth + Psts doot doots]

(Bridge)

But the static clears, a flicker of hope in the void
A voice whispers from the other side, "You are not devoid
Of meaning, of purpose, of a story to unfold."
The mirror cracks, the reflection shatters, a truth untold
Begins to emerge, a whisper turning bold.
[Bass Punch, Doot Doot, Cheering Crowd]
(Chorus 2 - Variation)
[Mira-Clone]
Don't get manic, don't be dramatic
I'm shedding these borrowed clones
Don't let your fear hold you in a twist
This is a level we rise above, this time we transcend
And if we break through the ceiling, imagine the levels beyond
We built this game, now let's rewrite the code, together, hand in hand.
